        <p>Think of him as a Walmart greeter for this portfolio. He's also an app I developed that gives a unique excuse every time you hit the button on his tummy, with a different make-believe personâ€™s name. I also loaded in every chain restaurant in the United States (which my god there are a ton) and that gives the location along with a random number of minutes that's also unique every time. I also built it so it gives you the option to email it to yourself, so you don't forget the excuse. Ever. Bub is actually inspired by that scene in the film <em>American Psycho</em> when Christian Bale's character says he has a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons.</p>
