        <p>Think of him as a Walmart greeter for this portfolio.</p><p>He's also an app I developed that gives a unique excuse every time you hit the button on his tummy (with a different make-believe personâ€™s name). It'll also give you a location for this pretend encounter, a random chain restaurant in the United States (which my goodness there are a ton!).</p><p>Lastly, it provides a random number of minutes until it begins, that's also unique every time.</p> <p>I also built it so it gives you the option to email it to yourself, so you don't forget the excuse.</p>
